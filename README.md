# Genesis Sample Sass

This is Genesis Sample 2.6.0's style.css split into Sass partials, taken from Christoph Herr's [Prometheus](https://github.com/christophherr/prometheus/tree/develop/scss) Genesis child theme.

## Note

Two additional files, `_home.scss` and `_custom.scss` have been added for your custom homepage and site-wide CSS.
